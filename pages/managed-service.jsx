          <p className="mb-4 font-medium text-xl">Dear friend,</p>
          <p className="mb-4 font-medium text-xl">
            It used to be very easy to get new clients with ads: pay a hefty fee
            and get guaranteed leads, easy as that.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 font-medium text-xl">
            But times have changed and now it's become increasingly difficult to
            get new clients using ads alone. People have become wary of SEO, and
            it's become more and more expensive to get new leads.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 font-medium text-xl">
            We've even worked with some clients who were paying up to{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">$20 per click</span>, which is kind of
            insane.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 font-medium text-xl">
            Think about it. Why pay exorbitant prices for ads when you you're
            not even sure if they'll be effective? And truth is, ads just aren't
            that reliable anymore.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 font-medium text-xl">
            What about Facebook Ads? Sure, they can be effective. But the thing
            is, you have no control over who's seeing your ads and whether or
            not they're converting into leads. Plus, the changes on the
            algorithm can quickly make your campaigns obsolete.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 font-medium text-xl">
            So, what can you do? Just cross your fingers and hope for the best?
          </p>
          <p className="font-medium text-xl">
            Luckily, there's an alternative: using cold emails to get new
            clients for your SEO agency.

            At SEO Leads Finder, we understand that so many SEO agencies are
            wasting money on ads and looking for a better way to get new
            clients, and we want to help you. Thatâ€™s why we offer cold email
            services, but with one caveat: we work manually with each one of our
            clients, and because of that, we can only onboard a limited number
            of customers at a time.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Artisanal work is the name of the game in this case, as it allows us
            to ensure that each and every customer gets their needs addressed
            individually and receives the personalized attention they deserve.
            As a result, this also means that our resources are confined to how
            many people we can reasonably handle at any given moment.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            By working with a limited number of customers at once, we're able to
            guarantee maximum results for everyone involved. We believe this is
            the best way to make sure all our clients reach their goals without
            having to compromise quality or results.
